# Zbot
A Discord bot for my private discord server.
It's currently using Riots API to get info from league of legends.

It's hosted on a ubuntu server VM on my FreeNAS server
I'm also using my other repo https://github.com/ZebastianBjorkqvist/WebHookAPIZBot to automatically build and run the bot using Github webhooks
